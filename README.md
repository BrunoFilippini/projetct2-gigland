# GigLand

A new way to land a new gig! A new way to offer gigs!

Remember those old websites that demanded hundreds of words to fill out a profile that got in the way of people getting hired or finding a professional to hire? Well, forget them! GigLand is the new online spot to find or offer a gig!

Gigland's objective introduction forms allow for quick introductions and cut down the chase. GigLand freelancers must show what they are about in a short sentence... that's what real talent is about: communicating who you are and what you do with just a couple of sentences. Organizations and individuals looking to hire someone must be brief and to the point: tell the world what the opportunity you're offering is about and the right person will show up in no time.

In your face, straight to the point, down to business. Time is money and work is fun... when talent is at the forefront and not busy, unnecessary long resumes and never ending forms.
